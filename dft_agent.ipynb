      "## Basis Set Family\n",
      "The Ahlrichs def2 basis set family is highly recommended for DFT calculations. This family includes basis sets such as def2-SVP, def2-TZVP, and def2-QZVP, which are well-balanced and cover most of the periodic table. The def2-TZVP (triple-zeta basis set with polarization functions) is particularly suggested as it provides a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency[2][3].\n",
      "\n",
      "## Convergence and Accuracy\n",
      "For organic and main-group molecules, a triple-zeta basis set (e.g., def2-TZVP) is often sufficient for converged geometries and energies. However, for more accurate results, especially in energies and properties, using a quadruple-zeta basis set (e.g., def2-QZVP) can be beneficial, although it is more computationally expensive[2].\n",
      "\n",
      "## Avoiding Small Basis Sets\n",
      "While double-zeta basis sets (e.g., def2-SVP or 6-31G*) can be useful for initial geometry optimizations, they should not be relied upon for accurate energies and properties. These smaller basis sets may give good enough structures but are not trustworthy for other molecular properties[2].\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency in Basis Set Choice\n",
      "It is important to stick with one family of basis sets for all elements in the system to avoid potential issues. Mixing basis sets from different families can lead to inconsistencies and is generally not recommended[2].\n",
      "\n",
      "## Auxiliary Basis Sets\n",
      "For calculations using the Resolution of the Identity (RI) approximation, it is essential to use appropriate auxiliary basis sets. The def2-XVP family has well-tested auxiliary basis sets (e.g., def2/J) that are designed for use with RI-J, RI-JK, and RIJCOSX approximations[1][2].\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, for DFT calculations on organic molecules, the def2-TZVP basis set from the Ahlrichs def2 family, combined with appropriate auxiliary basis sets, is a reliable and recommended choice.\n",
